<h1> Hunt-the-Wumpus </h1>
This project is the text version of the adventure game "Hunt the Wumpus"

<h2>
DESCRIPTION: </h1>You are in a pitch black cave with 20 rooms. </h2>
The rooms are arranged in a dodecahedron such that each room has three exits to other rooms.
<li>Some of the rooms have a bottomless pit.</li>  
<li>Some of the rooms have a colony of super bats.</li>
<li>Somewhere in the cave there is a sleeping Wumpus.</li>
<br>
<strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Your job is to kill the Wumpus before it kills you, or you fall into a pit.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
How to use this Repo: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Download all the files </li>
<li>Complile all the files </li>
<li>Once all files have been compiled, run the executable file ".exe" through the terminal </li>
NOTE: The main function for this project takes 3 arguments in this order: "Number of Bats", "Number of Pits", "Wumpus Tiredness".<br>
NOTE: In action, this would look something like: "./a.exe 3 0 0"
<li>Good luck with the hunt!</li>
